## Features

- **Lightweight**: Smaller and less resource-intensive than leading solutions.
- **Simple**: Easy setup with little manual configuration required.
- **Docker stats**: Tracks CPU, memory, and network usage history for each container.
- **Alerts**: Configurable alerts for CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth, temperature, load average, and status.
- **Multi-user**: Users manage their own systems. Admins can share systems across users.
- **OAuth / OIDC**: Supports many OAuth2 providers. Password auth can be disabled.
- **Automatic backups**: Save to and restore from disk or S3-compatible storage.
<!-- - **REST API**: Use or update your data in your own scripts and applications. -->

## Architecture

Beszel consists of two main components: the **hub** and the **agent**.

- **Hub**: A web application built on [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) that provides a dashboard for viewing and managing connected systems.
- **Agent**: Runs on each system you want to monitor and communicates system metrics to the hub.
